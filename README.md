# Advent of Code, Golang

**SPOILERS: This repo contains solutions to the Advent of Code game.**

These are my solutions to Advent of Code in go. Currently, I've only solved [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018/). I use AOC as a training. I'm new to go and still starting out as a dev. This game teaches me a lot of skills. I regularly check reddit for hints on how to solve this and also use [this](https://github.com/metalim/metalim.adventofcode.2018.go) great repo as a reference, as I'm not a great voodoo programmer myself (yet).

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is a little programming puzzle game describing itself:
>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
